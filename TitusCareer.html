        <p>If you haven't guessed it by now, I made it to the league. That's right I am a professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association. All the sacrifices my parents made and the hard work and discipline on my end paid off. Here I am living in dreams I could only imagine as a kid. I'm telling you, if you set your mind on something, you can do it. Don't let anyone get in your way. I am always in your corner.</p>

    <p>This book is paid for, so you don't have to turn it back in. I paid for it so a special person can enjoy it and have something of their very own. </p>

    <p>Tonight is a very special game. It is my debut as a pro player. My first game ever. Grab you parents and tell them you need to be there for the season opener tonight at 6:30pm at the FedEx Forum. There will be three courtside tickets and VIP passes with all the merchandise for the game, food and drinks. All on me.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
