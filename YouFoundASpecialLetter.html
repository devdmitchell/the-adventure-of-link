    <p>Let's get this right, you came to your neighborhood library in search of a book. Instead you've found me. Congratulations!
        I first want you to know you are smart and I am proud of you for expanding your knowledge through literature.
        I grew up in this neighborhood, coming to this very same library every week with my mom. She didn't play about reading, it was a must growing up in my home as a kid. Ma always said "reading books was the key to freedom." She wasn't lying about that. I grew a passion for reading, and now when I travel or need to clear my mind, I pick up a book. 
        Now that we have got that out the way, I have hidden treasure at the end of the book, should you read until the end, you'll soon find your prize! Do you accept the challenge? <a href="TitusOpening.html">Continue on if so...</a>
