        <p>My mom and dad met each other and starting dating because of their love for the game. People used to call them Melo and Lala. They both played the game but their teams were rivals. I told them I wanted to play basketball when I was five years old. Ma got on it right away. Dad worked and worked so he could get the money to get me training and put on a team. Ma was the one taking me to my practices and games. Dad came through when I needed to but the only way this worked was if he worked and Ma stayed home. It worked for us because my mom held it down while dad was away but dad always made his presence known. I couldn't have done it without either of them. So shoutout to my parents specifically and all the other parents grinding for a better life for their children.</p>
